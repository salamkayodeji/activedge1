* Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). For this
  guide, we assume Python is installed in `C:\Python36`.

### Installation in Ubuntu and mac

Python 3 is preinstalled in Ubuntu and mac. 

Since the program no dependencies we don't need to install or use virtual enviroment.

Run project

writing "python active.py" in terminal after activating virtual enviroment 

Project Details

1. I used a list because a list is an array in python
2. To try a different list just change variable A in active.py line 24 to another Array/List and run "python active.py" again for result

```
